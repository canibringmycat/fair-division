# Fair Division

A repository hosting all code written as part of an undergraduate research project. The project aims to improve the way cooperative game theory can be used to approach problems in computer science (e.g. resource allocation in cloud computing). The repository will be used to host all implementations of algorithms and test scripts used in this project.
